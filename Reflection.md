# Feedback
During the implementation of the R app, we took into account the feedback given during the previous implementations and the feedback given during peer review activities. The first change done was removing the trend line plot, because it added confusion to the users. Then we added tabs so that the users can move from one section to another in a smoother way. Descriptions were added to every plot to help users understand the usage of each plot. The color was set to be color blind friendly. In addition, in order to correct the lack of data in smaller demographic groups, we selected the top three more frequent groups to be displayed on the graphs. Finally, links to the source of the data and the drug information wesite were added.  

# Limitations

## Data

Regarding data, we think it can be expanded to wider populations so that we can see information on more demographic groups other than Connecticut.

## Visualization

In terms of visualization, we believe the app can only show combinations of up to 2 drugs. The visualization cannot show when a victim took more than 3 drugs at the same times. Even though we selected the top 3 groups for visualization purposes, more interactivity can be added to the plots, so that the user is able to display a wider range if they want to.
